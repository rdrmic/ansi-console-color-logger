# ansi-console-color-logger (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
Logging wrapper for [Eclipse's "Ansi Console" plugin](https://mihai-nita.net/2013/06/03/eclipse-plugin-ansi-in-console/) - enables console logging to be multicolored, which is helpful (at least to me) when there is lot of necessary output during development (e.g. multithreading, game development, etc).

There are 4 categories at the moment:
<ul>
  <li style="color:orange">debug</li>
</ul>

- <span style="color:green">info</span>
- <span style="color:red">emphasize</span>
- <span style="color:blue">special</span>
