# ansi-console-color-logger // UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Logging wrapper for Eclipse's "Ansi Console" plugin - enables console logging to be multicolored, which is helpful (at least to me) when there is lot of necessary output during development (e.g. multithreading, game development, etc).

At the moment, there are 4 categories:
    - debug
    - info
    - emphasize
    - special
